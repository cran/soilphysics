\title{ Preconsolidation Stress }

\description{
A function to determine the preconsolidation stress (\eqn{\sigma_P}). It is a parameter obtained from 
the soil compression curve and has been used as an indicator of soil load-bearing capacity as well as to 
characterize the impacts suffered by the use of machines. 
The function \code{sigmaP()} contains implementations of the main methods for determining the pre-consolidation 
stress, such as the Casagrande method, the method of Pacheco Silva, the regression methods and the method of the 
virgin compression line intercept.
}

\usage{
sigmaP(voidratio, stress, n4VCL = 3,
    method = c("casagrande", "VCLzero", "reg1", "reg2", "reg3", "reg4", "pacheco"),
    mcp = NULL, graph = TRUE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{voidratio}{ a numeric vector containing void ratio (or bulk density) values. }
  \item{stress}{ a numeric vector containing the applied stress sequence.}
  \item{n4VCL}{ the number of points for calculating the slope of the soil Virgin Compression Line (VCL),
                which is obtained by linear regression. }
  \item{method}{ a character indicating which method is to be computed; one of the following:
                 \code{casagrande} (default), \code{VCLzero}, \code{reg1}, \code{reg2}, \code{reg3},
                 \code{reg4} or \code{pacheco}; see Details. }
  \item{mcp}{ the maximum curvature point in log10 scale of \code{stress}; required only if the
   		method \code{casagrande} is used. }
  \item{graph}{ logical; if TRUE (default) the compression curve is plotted. }
  \item{\dots}{ further graphical arguments. }
}

\details{
\code{casagrande} is the method proposed by Casagrande (1936). The preconsolidation stress obtained via \code{VCLzero} corresponds
to the intersection of the soil \emph{Virgin Compression Line} (VCL) with the x-axis at zero applied stress, as described by
Arvidsson & Keller (2004). \code{reg1}, \code{reg2}, \code{reg3} and \code{reg4} are regression methods that obtain the preconsolidation
stress value as the intercept of the VCL and a regression line fitted with the first two, three, four and five points of the curve, respectively,
as described by Dias Junior & Pierce (1995). \code{pacheco} is the method of Pacheco Silva (ABNT, 1990).
